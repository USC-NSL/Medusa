# Medusa
*A Programming Framework for Crowd-Sensing Applications*

Have you ever wished, in the middle of a research project, for a 
convenient way to recruit smartphone and tablet users worldwide 
to contribute data (images, videos, sound) using the sensors on 
their devices for your project?

Medusa is software that makes this capability, that we call 
crowd-sensing, possible. Medusa will let you program a crowd-sensing 
task easily and its software will automatically handle the tedious 
aspects of crowd-sensing: recruiting contributors, paying them, 
and processing and collecting data from mobile devices. 
Medusa also respects contributor privacy and anonymity.

The [demo video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL1dGA21ciA) explains 
Medusa with an example.

## Project Details

Medusa was developed by Moo-Ryong Ra in collaboration with Bin Liu, Tom La Porta, Ramesh Govindan, and Matthew McCartney at [USC](http://www.usc.edu).

A thorough description of Medusa can be found at the Networked Systems Lab [project page for Medusa](http://nsl.cs.usc.edu/Projects/Medusa)
